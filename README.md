## Quick Start
- Create a new hugo site
```
hugo new site my-new-blog
```

- Install this theme
```
cd my-new-blog/themes
git clone https://github.com/Lednerb/bilberry-hugo-theme.git
```
If you don't use git, you can download and extract this theme manually into the themes folder. <br>
Please ensure that the folder is renamed to "bilberry-hugo-theme"

- Copy example content and default config file for a quick start
```
cp -r bilberry-hugo-theme/exampleSite/* ../
```

- Test and configure your site
```
cd ../
hugo server -D
```


## Configuration
To configure your site according to your needs, just open the `config.toml` file in your project folder and adjust the settings.
All options you can and should customize are commented so it should be no problem for you to get it done.


## Features


### Algolia Search
Bilberry includes a convenient search functionality for your site.
You can test it on the demo site.
Just click on the navigation bar at the top right of the header.


### Setup
If you do not want to use the search functionality set `algolia_search = false` in your `config.toml` file.

If you want to include the algolia search for your site, you have to follow these steps:

1. Register for a free Algolia Search account at https://www.algolia.com/
2. Add a `New Application`. You can choose the `COMMUNITY` plan.
3. Switch over to `Indices` and create a new one.
4. Switch over to `API Keys` and copy your `Application ID`, `Search-Only API Key` and chosen `Index name` to your `config.toml` file.
5. Ensure that `algolia_search = true` is set.


### Update the search index
You have to repeat this step every time you change a post or publish a new one to update the search index.

1. Publish your changes via the `hugo` command.
2. Head over to `http://your-site.com/index.json` and copy everything in there
3. Login to your algolia account, open your index and click at `Add records manually`
4. Paste the copied text from the `index.json` file.
5. Done.


### Keyboard Shortcuts
If you want to start a search on your blog simply type `s` and the search menu will open.

To close it again you can enter `esc` at any time.


### Post Types
Bilberry comes with a bunch of predefined post types.
Available post types are `article`, `audio`, `code`, `gallery`, `link`, `page`, `quote` and `video`.

To use a post type, just create new content via the hugo command.<br>
For example:
```
hugo new quote/edward-snowden-about-privacy.md
```

`article` is the default post type if you want to use another type of content as the predefined.

Just discover the entries from the `exampleSite` folder to get an overview of the great possibilities Bilberry provides ;-)


### Pages and External Links
The post type `page` is the only one that appears in the top navigation (when you click on the navigation button on the top right).

A `page` can be a static page (about me or impress site) or a link to another page as it is used in the demo to link to the Bilberry GitHub repository.

The post type `link` always links to an external site and can be used with or without a background image.


### Manual Summary Breaks
You can influence the summary outpot on the listing pages (such as the home page or the category or tag pages) in three ways:

- You don't set a manual summary break. <br>
Hugo will care for you and generates a summary as well as a _Continue reading_ link.

- You set a manual break via `<!--more-->` <br>
Just write your content and if you want to break use the code snippet to tell Hugo to break here.

- You want to display the full article without a _Continue reading_ link <br>
In this case, set the option `noSummary: true` in the header area (Front Matter) of your `.md` file.


### Disqus comments
If you want to enable the functionality for your users to write comments below your articles, you can register for a free [Disqus](https://disqus.com) account.

Just create a new site and copy your site's short name to the `config.toml` file at `disqusShortname`.

You can manage and moderate the comments either on your website or at the disqus management panel.

### Responsive Design
Bilberry is optimized for desktop and mobile devices (tablets and smartphones).

### Permanent Top Navigation
If you want to permanently display the top navigation with the algolia search bar and the `page` entries, you can set the `permanentTopNav` option to `true` in your site's config file.

Note that on mobile devices the navigation will still be collapsed because otherwise, the navigation menu hides the essential parts of your site.

### MathJAX Markup

If you want to add [MathJAX](https://www.mathjax.org) markup support, set parameter `enable_mathjax` option to `true` in our site's config file.

## Custom Post Types
If you want to add a custom post type to change the icon in the bubble on the left column you can simply create those as you wish.

If you want to create a `book` post type, for example, you can do the following:

1. Copy the default `themes/bilberry-hugo-theme/layouts/partials/content-type/article.html` to your site's `layouts/partials/content-type/` folder.
2. Rename the file to your custom post type. A proper name in the _book scenario_ would be `book.html`
3. Customize the file. <br> You can change the icon in the bubble with another [Font Awesome Icon](http://fontawesome.io/icons/). <br> In the _book scenario_ we would change the `fa-pencil` class to `fa-book`:
`<i class="fa fa-fw fa-book"></i>`

4. Create your new posts with the post type prefix: `hugo new book/a-very-cool-book.md`
5. Done.

If you want to use custom Front Matter variables, create a `book.md` archetype in your `archetypes/` directory.

You can find further information in the official HUGO docs.

--------------

If you want to change the default post types (e.g., don't use the pencil icon on the `article` or default type, but another one) copy the original file to your local `layouts/partials/content-type/` directory and edit it there. <br>
Otherwise, your changes would be overwritten when you update to the latest theme version.


# Custom colors and fonts
Bilberry uses SCSS for styling and a Webpack-based workflow to dynamically create the combined and compresses production-ready stylesheets.

If you want to change any colors or fonts, you have follow these steps:

1. Install this theme to your `themes` directory
2. Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
3. `cd themes/bilberry-hugo-theme/src`
4. Run `yarn install` to install all necessary dependencies
5. Modify the `scss/_variables.scss` file to customize your colors. <br> If you want to change the header's color just edit the `$base-color` variable
6. After finishing your changes, run `yarn run production` to produce your customized stylesheets
7. Done

If you 're going to change the default fonts (e.g., lack of support for Cyrillic languages), you can use some of the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com).
Select your favorite fonts and copy the `@import url('...');` directive to the `src/css/fonts.css` file.
Now you have to modify the `scss/_variables.scss` and set the `$headline-font` and `$content-font` to the selected ones.

Follow the steps 1-7 to implement your custom font to your site.

_Note:_ You don't have to upload the `node_modules` folder to your webspace, this is only created and needed to generate your customized stylesheets.


## Credits

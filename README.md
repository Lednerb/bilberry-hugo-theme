## Requirements

**Hugo version >= 0.53 required**

## Quick Start

- Create a new hugo site
```
hugo new site my-new-blog
```

- Install the latest version of this  theme
```
cd my-new-blog/themes
git clone https://github.com/Lednerb/bilberry-hugo-theme.git
```
If you don't use git, you can download this theme [HERE](https://github.com/Lednerb/bilberry-hugo-theme/archive/master.zip) and extract it manually into the themes folder. <br>
Please ensure that the folder is renamed to "bilberry-hugo-theme"

- Copy example content and default config file for a quick start
```
cp -r bilberry-hugo-theme/exampleSite/* ../
```

- Remove the default archetype
```
cd ../
rm archetypes/default.md
```

- Test and configure your site
```
hugo server -D
```

__Important:__ <br>
Do NOT change the name of the theme folder. <br>
If you rename the folder, the different post types will not work.

Also, check out this [tutorial](https://www.kiroule.com/article/start-blogging-with-github-hugo-and-netlify/) on how to build a Bilberry theme-based website using Hugo, GitHub, and Netlify.

## Configuration
To configure your site according to your needs, just open the `config.toml` file in your project folder and adjust the settings.
All options you can and should customize are commented out, so it should be no problem for you to get it done.

Also, you can read this [write-up](https://www.kiroule.com/article/manage-environment-specific-settings-for-hugo-based-website/) on how to manage
environment-specific settings for a Hugo-based website.

## Features


### Algolia Search
Bilberry includes a convenient search functionality for your site.
You can test it on the demo site.
Just click on the navigation bar at the top right of the header.


#### Setup
If you do not want to use the search functionality set `algolia_search = false` in your `config.toml` file.

If you want to include the algolia search for your site, you have to follow these steps:

1. Register for a free Algolia Search account at https://www.algolia.com/
2. Add a `New Application`. You can choose the `COMMUNITY` plan.
3. Switch over to `Indices` and create a new one.
4. Switch over to `API Keys` and copy your `Application ID`, `Search-Only API Key` and chosen `Index name` to your `config.toml` file.
5. Ensure that `algolia_search = true` is set.
6. Check the next section [Update the search index](#update-the-search-index), follow the steps and come back again
7. Go to the tab `Configuration` of your newly created indices, select the `Facets` in the section `FILTERING AND FACETING` and add the `language` attribute with the `filter only` modifier in the `Attributes for faceting` option. If, after adding the `language` attribute, the `Unknown attribute` error is shown, ignore it.
8. Done.


#### Update the Search Index
You have to repeat this step every time you change a post or publish a new one to update the search index.

Execute the 'hugo' command in the site's root directory to publish your changes.

* Manual Upload
    * Head over to the `public/index.json` file and copy everything in there.
    * Login to your Algolia account, open your index and click at `Add records manually`.
    * Paste the copied text from the `index.json` file.
    * Verify in the `Browse` tab of your index that the index records were uploaded correctly.
    * If case you have a multi-language setup, make sure that you repeat the steps above for all `public/{LANG}/index.json` files

* Automated Upload
    * Prerequisites: installed Python 3 and Algolia API's [Python client](https://github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-client-python). The API Python client can be installed with the following command:
    ```shell script
    pip install --upgrade 'algoliasearch>=2.0,<3.0'
    ```
    * Execute the `algolia-index-upload.py` from the site's root directory as follows:
    ```shell script
    python3 algolia-index-upload.py -f public/index.json -a <algolia-app-id> -k <algolia-admin-api-key> -n <algolia-index-name>
    ```
    * The `algolia-admin-api-key` argument, namely your Algolia account's `Admin API Key`, is used to create, update, and delete indices, and it should be kept secret.
    * Login to your Algolia account and verify in the `Browse` tab of your index that the index records were uploaded correctly.
    * If case you have a multi-language setup, make sure that you repeat the steps above for all `public/{LANG}/index.json` files

Also, you can read this [write-up](https://www.kiroule.com/article/automate-index-upload-to-algolia-search/) on how to automate
index upload to Algolia Search if you host your Bilberry theme-based website on Netlify.

### Keyboard Shortcuts
If you want to start a search on your blog simply type `s` and the search menu will open.

To close it again you can enter `esc` at any time.


### Post Types
Bilberry comes with a bunch of predefined post types.
Available post types are `article`, `audio`, `code`, `gallery`, `link`, `page`, `quote`, `status` and `video`.

To use a post type, just create new content via the hugo command.<br>
For example:
```
hugo new quote/edward-snowden-about-privacy.md
```

`article` is the default post type if you want to use another type of content as the predefined.

Just discover the entries from the `exampleSite` folder to get an overview of the great possibilities Bilberry provides ;-)


### Pages and External Links
The post type `page` is the only one that appears in the top navigation (when you click on the navigation button on the top right).
Pages can be ordered using the `weight` front matter variable, which should be set to a non-zero value. A page with a lower `weight` will be displayed first.

A `page` can be a static page (about me or impress site) or a link to another page as it is used in the demo to link to the Bilberry GitHub repository.

The post type `link` always links to an external site and can be used with or without a background image.

### Reposting an Article / Duplicated Content [SEO]
If you want to repost an article from another website or have duplicated content on your own site, for SEO reasons it's a good practice to link to the original / `canonical` URL.

If you want to mark one of your content sites as duplicated content you can simply use the following front matter configuration option:

```
original_url: "https://example.org/path/to/content"
```

Further Information:
- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_link_element)

### Overwrite the calculated reading time
If you want to overwrite the automatically calculated reading time for a post you can use the following front matter confguration option:

```
readingTime: 7 # integer for the amount of minutes
```

### Summary Breaks
You can influence the summary output on the listing pages (such as the home page or the category or tag pages) in different ways:

- You don't set a manual summary break. <br>
Hugo will care for you and generates a summary as well as a _Continue reading_ link.

- You set a manual break via `<!--more-->` <br>
Just write your content and if you want to break use the code snippet to tell Hugo to break here.

- You want to display the full article without a _Continue reading_ link <br>
In this case, set the option `noSummary: true` in the header area (Front Matter) of your `.md` file.

- You can define a summary that differs from the first content lines <br>
Use the `summary: "Here goes my summary"` Front Matter variable. <br>
In this case no _Continue reading_ link will be displayed.

### Table of Contents(TOC)
To enable the automatic creation of a table of contents(TOC), set the `toc` front matter variable to true in your article. If the article's markdown contains appropriate headings, Hugo will generate a table of content at the beginning of the article. 

By default, a TOC is generated if the content's word count is greater than **400**. The `tocMinWordCount` parameter defines this value in the `config.toml` configuration file. 

The headings that are taken into account for a TOC are from _H2_ (##) to _H5_ (#####) inclusive. Also, if you want to display a TOC at a specific point in your article, set the `toc` front matter variable to false, and use the `toc` shortcode like this:
```markdown
{{< toc >}}
```

### Series Taxonomy ###
In case you want to group some articles as a series, you have to add the `series` front matter variable to each article and set its value to the name of the series, for example, `series: "My New Super Series"`.

The page at `<site-base-url>/series/` will list all the series. To list all articles for a particular series within markdown, you can use the `series` shortcode with the series name in question, for instance: 
```markdown
{{< series "My New Super Series" >}}
```

### Comments
Currently [Commento](https://commento.io/) and [Disqus](https://disqus.com) are supported.

#### Commento comments
If you want to enable the functionality for your users to write comments below your articles, you can either register account at [commento.io](https://commento.io/) or [host Commento yourself](https://docs.commento.io/getting-started/self-hosting/).

To activate Commento in your blog you have to add the URL for the JS-snippet to `commentoJsURL` in your `config.toml`.

**Example:**

Snippet displayed in Commento:
```html
<script defer src="http://localhost:8080/js/commento.js"></script>
<div id="commento"></div>
```

Your `config.toml`
```toml
#[...]
[params]

    #[...]

    # Commento
    commentoJsURL = "http://localhost:8080/js/commento.js"
```


#### Disqus comments
If you want to enable the functionality for your users to write comments below your articles, you can register for a free [Disqus](https://disqus.com) account.

Just create a new site and copy your site's short name to the `config.toml` file at `disqusShortname`.

You can manage and moderate the comments either on your website or at the disqus management panel.


### Responsive Design
Bilberry is optimized for desktop and mobile devices (tablets and smartphones).

### Automatic Image Resizing
The bilberry theme handles image crops and resizes automatically by default.
However, if you want to disable this functionality in general, you can set `resizeImages: false` in your `config.toml` file.

If you want to disable this functionality just on some posts, you can set `resizeImages: false` in your post's frontmatter settings.

### Image Modal Zoom
When including an image that has larger dimensions than the content area, the image gets clickable and a bigger version will open in a lightbox.

### Permanent Top Navigation
If you want to permanently display the top navigation with the algolia search bar and the `page` entries, you can set the `permanentTopNav` option to `true` in your site's config file.

Note that on mobile devices the navigation will still be collapsed because otherwise, the navigation menu hides the essential parts of your site.

### MathJAX Markup
If you want to add [MathJAX](https://www.mathjax.org) markup support, set parameter `enable_mathjax` option to `true` in your site's config file.

### Disabled Javascript Support
Although this theme has a lot of features that only work with enabled javascript, it also fully supports disabled javascript.
Disabling javascript will not break any styles or essential functionality on the site.

Just head over to the demo page, disable javascript in your browser and check the results!

## Favicons
Using favicons nowadays is not a trivial thing.
There are many different sizes and file types for the various mobile and desktop browsers and for the shortcuts for Android and iOS devices.

This theme makes it easy for you to include all needed files:

1. Visit https://realfavicongenerator.net/ and generate your favicon according to your needs
2. Copy & Paste the generated files into your `/static` folder
3. Edit the `/layouts/partials/favicon.html` file and copy & paste the HTML code from the generated instruction

**Important:**
You have to follow the [Quick Start](#Quick-Start) guideline or manually copy the `/layouts/partials/favicon.html` file from the theme to your site's `/layouts` directory. Otherwise the file is missing.

## Custom 404 site
If you want to customize your 404 site, copy the `themes/bilberry-hugo-theme/layouts/404.html` to your local `layouts/404.html` and edit the file.

You can quickly change the message and / or the icon class for example.
Otherwise, you can replace the whole content with your 404 site markup.

## Custom Post Types
If you want to add a custom post type to change the icon in the bubble on the left column you can simply create those as you wish.

If you want to create a `book` post type, for example, you can do the following:

1. Copy the default `themes/bilberry-hugo-theme/layouts/partials/content-type/article.html` to your site's `layouts/partials/content-type/` folder.
2. Rename the file to your custom post type. A proper name in the _book scenario_ would be `book.html`
3. Customize the file. <br> You can change the icon in the bubble with another [Font Awesome Icon](http://fontawesome.io/icons/). <br> In the _book scenario_ we would change the `fa-pencil` class to `fa-book`:
`<i class="fas fa-fw fa-book"></i>`

4. Create your new posts with the post type prefix: `hugo new book/a-very-cool-book.md`
5. Done.

If you want to use custom Front Matter variables, create a `book.md` archetype in your `archetypes/` directory.

You can find further information in the official HUGO docs.

## External Images
If you want to use external images (on another server or installation, etc.) for the `featuredImage` or in the `gallery` post type, you can use them by specifying the following in the post's config within the frontmatter:

`/content/article/my-external-featured-image-post.md`
```
featuredImage: "https://example.org/images/my-image.jpg"
```

`/content/gallery/my-external-gallery-post.md`
```
gallery: [
    "https://example.org/images/gallery-image1.jpg",
    "https://example.org/images/gallery-image2.jpg",
    "https://example.org/images/gallery-image3.jpg"
]
```

## Customizing Individual Posts

Posts can be customized via a variety of options.

To exclude posts from appearing on your blog index, while still being displayed in categories, add `excludeFromIndex: true` to the post configuration.

The theme also has options for a pinned post. Just uncomment `pinnedPost` in `config.toml`, and point it to the post you'd like permanently pinned to the top of the page. The `pinOnlyToFirstPage` setting lets you control if you'd like to only display the pinned post on the index, or on all pages.

A custom icon can be declared per post, by specifying a font-awesome icon in the post configuration, such as `icon: fa-thumb-tack` for a pinned post.

--------------

If you want to change the default post types (e.g., don't use the pencil icon on the `article` or default type, but another one) copy the original file to your local `layouts/partials/content-type/` directory and edit it there. <br>
Otherwise, your changes would be overwritten when you update to the latest theme version.


## Custom colors and fonts
Bilberry uses SCSS for styling and NPM with [Laravel Mix](https://laravel-mix.com/) for dependency management.

If you want to change any colors or fonts, you have to follow these steps:

1. Install this theme to your `themes` directory
2. `cd themes/bilberry-hugo-theme`
3. `npm install`
4. Modify the `assets/sass/_variables.scss` file to customize your colors. <br> If you want to change the header's color just edit the `$base-color` variable
5. Use `npm run dev` for development and preview purposes and `npm run production` when you finished the changes


## CSS and JS modules
This theme supports hot-swappable CSS and JavaScript extensions. Modules can be specified using the `(css|js)_modules` list parameter. Modules can be specified either relative to the `static` directory (e.g. `exampleSite/static/css/custom.css`) or as a URL.

Modules are imported in the order they appear in the list, and immediately after the default Bilberry CSS and JS files are imported.

### Adding a Cookie disclaimer
Depending on the type of website you are running with this theme you may also want to add a cookie consent information. The popular solution [cookie consent](https://cookieconsent.insites.com/) can be integrated into the theme by loading the resources as external CSS and JS modules.

Use the configurator on the [cookie consent website](https://cookieconsent.insites.com/) to generate the required initialization code and add it to a local `static/init-cookieconsent.js` file e.g.

```javascript
// https://cookieconsent.insites.com/download/#
window.addEventListener('load', function () {
  window.cookieconsent.initialise({
    'palette': {
      'popup': {
        'background': '#cc0033'
      },
      'button': {
        'background': '#fff'
      }
    }
  })
})
```

Then you only need to modify your `config.toml` to load the local init script and the libraries. You can either download the files and put them in your `/static` directory as well or reference them directly using a CDN.
Serving the files with your website reduces external dependencies, increases privacy and makes sure your website can be developed in an offline environment as well.

```toml
css_modules = ["..", "//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/cookieconsent2/3.1.0/cookieconsent.min.css"]
js_modules = ["..", "//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/cookieconsent2/3.1.0/cookieconsent.min.js", "init-cookieconsent.js"]
```

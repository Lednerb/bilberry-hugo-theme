   static/images/patreon.png

   # NEW structure
   content/article/support-me-and-this-theme/index.md

   ```

- `gallery: []` parameter <br>
   The next version will support [Page Resources](http://gohugo.io/content-management/page-resources/) so you should have a better folder structure and you change:
   ```
   # OLD Structure / deprecated
   content/gallery/my-trip-to-scotland.md
   static/images/scotland1.jpg
   static/images/scotland2.jpg
   ...

   # NEW structure
   content/gallery/my-trip-to-scotland/index.md
   content/article/my-trip-to-scotland/scotland1.jpg
   content/article/my-trip-to-scotland/scotland2.jpg

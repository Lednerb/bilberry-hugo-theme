- gravatar and custom image integration for the header
- keyboard shortcut for the search (press the `s` key, type something and hit `enter` or `esc`)
- responsive design - optimized for desktop and mobile devices
- full internationalization (i18n) support (en, de, fr, ru, es out of the box!)
- full multi-language support
- custom post types (`article`, `audio`, `code`, `gallery`, `link`, `page`, `picture`, `quote`, `video`)
    - easy configuration to add more according to your needs
